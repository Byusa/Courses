# Question
We need to build a system that provides a webhook for 3 external data sources to push data to as it becomes available.   The 3 sources contain all of the required data, but are in different formats (xml, json, etc) with different schemas.     The data should be surfaced in two ways, an analytics dashboard that provides top level summary statistics about the data ingested, and a explore webpage that allows users to view, modify, sort, and filter the individual data rows.

# Answer
### System Design for a Data Ingestion, Analytics, and Exploration System

This design outlines the components and workflow to create a system that can handle data ingestion from multiple external sources, normalize the data, and present it through an analytics dashboard and an exploration interface. 

#### Key Requirements:
1. **Webhook for 3 External Data Sources**:
   - The system will accept data from 3 different sources, which push data in different formats (XML, JSON, etc.) with varying schemas.
   - The webhook needs to handle these requests, validate and normalize the incoming data.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Convert data from various formats into a unified schema for storage and further processing.
   - Ensure both raw and transformed data are stored for audit and reprocessing purposes.

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Provide top-level summary statistics about the ingested data.
   - Enable users to view metrics such as total records, data ingestion volume, and time-based summaries (last 30 days, today, etc.).

4. **Explore Webpage**:
   - Allow users to view individual records in a tabular format.
   - Enable sorting, filtering, and modifying records through a user-friendly interface.

### High-Level System Components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer (Webhook)**:
   - A set of webhook endpoints to receive data from the external sources.
   - Each source posts data to these endpoints in real-time.
   - The system must validate incoming requests and data (e.g., ensure it's from a trusted source using API keys or OAuth).
   - Incoming data might be XML, JSON, or other formats, requiring appropriate parsers.

2. **Data Normalization/Transformation Layer**:
   - **Parser Components**: To convert the XML, JSON, and other formats into a common, unified schema.
   - **Normalization Logic**: A mapping engine to transform data from varying schemas into a standardized structure.
   - **Validation**: Ensure that data integrity is maintained, checking for required fields and consistent data types.

3. **Data Storage Layer**:
   - **Raw Data Store**: Stores the unprocessed/raw data as it arrives, preserving the original format for reprocessing, auditing, or troubleshooting.
   - **Normalized Data Store**: Stores the transformed data in a structured format. This store will be used for both the exploration and analytics components.
   - Use a **relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)** for structured storage of normalized data.
   - The database should allow indexing and partitioning for fast querying and scalability.

4. **Processing & Aggregation Layer**:
   - **Real-time ETL**: Extract, transform, and load the data into the normalized data store.
   - **Analytics Processor**: Calculate key statistics (record counts, data volume, source breakdown) based on incoming data, either in real time or in batches.
   - **Batch Processor**: Ingested data can be processed in batches to update the analytics dashboard periodically (e.g., hourly summaries).

5. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - **Backend Service**: Queries the database for summary statistics (e.g., total records ingested, breakdown by data source, volume per time period).
   - **Frontend Interface**: A dashboard UI providing high-level metrics using visualizations like charts and graphs.
   - **Data Caching**: Pre-aggregate and cache statistics for performance efficiency.

6. **Explore Webpage**:
   - **Frontend UI**: An interactive web interface where users can:
     - View individual records in a tabular format.
     - Sort and filter records based on criteria like data source, date, or specific fields.
     - Modify data fields (with form validation).
   - **Backend Service**: Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs to enable interaction with the normalized data.
   - **Pagination and Search**: Handle large datasets efficiently by implementing pagination and server-side search/filtering logic.

### Workflow:

1. **Webhook Integration**:
   - External data sources push data to the webhook.
   - The webhook service authenticates and validates the incoming data.

2. **Data Parsing & Normalization**:
   - Depending on the format (XML, JSON, etc.), the system invokes appropriate parsers.
   - The parsed data is transformed into a unified schema for storage and further use.
   - Both the raw and normalized data are stored.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - The normalized data is stored in a relational database for structured querying.
   - The raw data is stored in its original format in case it's needed for reprocessing or auditing.

4. **Analytics Generation**:
   - The system either computes real-time summary statistics (e.g., last 30 days, todayâ€™s ingested data) or uses batch processing to update the analytics dashboard at set intervals (e.g., hourly).
   - Aggregated data is cached to optimize performance.

5. **Explore Webpage**:
   - Users interact with the explore page to view, sort, filter, and edit individual data records.
   - The explore page queries the normalized data from the database and returns it in a paginated, filterable format.

### Scalability & Optimization Considerations:

1. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**:
   - Implement rate limiting on the webhooks to prevent any of the external sources from overloading the system with too many requests.

2. **Message Queue for Reliability**:
   - Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) between the webhook and the normalization process to decouple data ingestion from data processing. This ensures that the system can handle spikes in traffic and guarantees data delivery.

3. **Indexing & Query Optimization**:
   - Use proper indexing on key fields (e.g., timestamp, data source, key identifiers) to optimize database queries for both the analytics dashboard and the explore page.

4. **Caching for Analytics**:
   - Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed summary statistics to minimize the load on the database.

5. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Scale the webhooks horizontally to handle high incoming traffic from the data sources.
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple webhook instances.

6. **Database Partitioning**:
   - Partition the database based on time (e.g., partition by month) or by data source to improve performance for large datasets.

7. **Security**:
   - Ensure that the webhook is protected with authentication mechanisms like API keys or OAuth.
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication between the external data sources and the system.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the explore page, limiting who can view and modify data.

### Summary:

- **Webhook Ingestion**: Receives data from three different sources, supporting multiple formats like XML and JSON.
- **Data Transformation**: Parses, validates, and normalizes the data into a unified schema.
- **Data Storage**: Stores both raw and normalized data for further processing.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides high-level summary statistics using pre-aggregated data.
- **Explore Webpage**: Allows users to view, modify, filter, and sort individual data rows in a tabular format.
- **Scalability**: Uses caching, load balancing, and message queues to handle high volumes of data ingestion and query requests.
